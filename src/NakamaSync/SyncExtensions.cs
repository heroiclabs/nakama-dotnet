// todo entire concurrency pass on all this
// should var registry have a dictionary or should it have methods?
// TODO what if someone changes the type collection that the key is in, will try to send to the incorrect type
// between clients and may pass handshake.
// if user leaves and then rejoins do their values come back? they are still in collection but
// are they received by that user on initial sync? I think so.
// catch all exceptions and route them through the OnError event? have to think about ones that cannot be handled.
// todo protobuf support when that is merged.
// todo think about fact that user can still attach to presence handler without being able to sequence presence events as they see fit.
// todo synced composite object?
// todo synced list
// todo potential race when creating and joining a match between the construction of this object
// and the dispatching of presence objects off the socket.
// TODO restore the default getvalue call with self
// think about end match flow, resetting sync vars.
// to string calls
// expose interfaces, not concrete classes.
// todo create hostvar.
// todo handle host changed
// todo handle guest left
// todo migrate pending values when host changes
// override tostring
// todo remove any event subscriptions in constructors.
// todo parameter ordering
// todo internalize the registry so that users can't change it from the outside?
// otherwise find some other way to prevent users from messing with it.
// todo error handling checks particularly on dictionary accessing etc.
// should user vars have acks on a user by user basis?
// what if clients don't agree on opcodes? how can you establish that they are on different binary versions?
// todo shouldn't have public sets on the DTOs but need it due to tinyjson
// todo add the reflection approach?
// todo too many params in sync extensions methods
// todo expose metadata to match id method.
// think about what should happen to local changes that occur before the initial store is synced from handshake.
// maybe it's game specific?
// todo what happens if you set a var prior to passing it through the match? throw an exception from the var itself?
// add a "HasValue" helper to the user var for a particular value
// debate pros and cons of user id vs user presence for user vars/values. i think we do want to use
// userpresence, but it's just a matter of serializing interface rather than concrete type.
// expose an OnLocalVariable changed event for users.
// renamed SharedVar to GlobalVar?
// think about if leavematch should clear all variables as opposed to being dropped from a match
// which would keep the variables there?
// todo create a syncmatch struct and expose presences.
// add null checks for inputs and maybe more input validation
// whole presencevarcollection?
// todo make sure you can
// does usemainthread need to be true? test with both
